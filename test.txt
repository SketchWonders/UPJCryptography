Dear whomever, 

	I firmly believe that you should not implement the requirement that students 
seeking to enroll in the follow-up STEM course need to have been accepted into upper level 
education. I feel this is not only unnecessary but also, unfair. The five students 
currently enrolled in the STEM course come from a variety of backgrounds; while one 
student may be relatively new to education, another may already be in a Methods 
course. At the time of enrollment, there were no true prerequisites to the program. 
To instill these now, after we are halfway through the class would merely make 
completing the endorsement impossible for some students.
	I do understand some of the concerns with not enlisting the requirement. For one, 
students will not have been properly shown a “regular” classroom. To that, I argue 
that we are trying to incorporate STEM into all classrooms; why teach tradition? To 
me, this is akin to learning to teach a “normal” classroom before learning to teach an
 inclusive one. That makes no sense, because inclusive class- rooms ARE our normal 
classrooms. Thus, the issue should not be that we do not yet understand the “normal” 
classroom. For another, students do not yet understand how to prepare a lesson plan. 
To that, I argue that not only will we have to create our first lesson plan at some 
point, but also, we have sufficient resources to help accommodate us on what a lesson 
plan should and should not look like. 
	Overall, this is just a draft so I don’t sound ticked when I talk to Dr. Z, but 
figured it would work for this.
